<h1>The Visual Rhetoric of College Football Uniforms</h1>


<h2>By Becky Daleiden</h2>

<p>I should start out by simply stating that I am in no way the biggest college football fan. However&#44; I am a big fan of fashion. Something that has always interested me are college football uniforms and the reasoning behind certain teams&#39; constant changes. And while I&#39;m not the biggest fan of football&#44; the one team that I&#39;ve followed and been a fan of all my life is the Crimson Tide. What strikes me even more about Alabama&#39;s legacy is how they can get away with never touching their uniforms and are still the highest recruited team. My initial thought is that maybe it was because they are simply the greatest of all time (a biased thought?). After deeply searching and putting pieces from Aristotele&#39;s together with knowledge from recent articles published by ESPN and other well-known sport sites&#44; I discovered something worth discussing. Coaches and recruiters use the uniforms as a tool for persuading new prospects to try out for their teams. As simply put as its said&#44; I can assure that its anything but. There are dozens of layers and strategies different teams use in order to give their school and their team a name- and even more- a brand. </p>

<p>A new trend has risen in the college football uniform industry and it&#39;s a trend that some people&#44; including team members&#44; find annoying. The trendsetter in this uniform madness is the Oregon Ducks. An article in the For The Win website&#44; a well-known football column&#44; calls Oregon&#44; &quot;The godfather of uniforms&quot;. The college team has about 60 different combinations of uniforms&#44; thanks to their sponsorship with Nike. This season&#44; the Ducks released six new combinations of uniforms for their players to wear while other teams in the district released one or two. The history of the ever-so-changing uniforms is quite small&#44; as the changes stated occurring only in 1996 when Nike co-founder Phil Knight began the partnership with the Ducks. The teams weren&#39;t highly recognized before this collaboration&#44; therefore the amount of people interested in joining their team was small. The Daily Emerald says the change was &quot;to better attract future players to the team&quot; &#40;Morrison&#44; 2018&#41;. Therefore&#44; as years continued&#44; the uniforms became flashier. It got the to the point where the team was switching uniforms on a weekly basis. The team was finally being recognized and they were finally getting people interested in joining their team. </p>

<p>In the eyes of Landa&#44; we now know that the target audience of this constant change are high school players who are interested in joining college football. They want to make their team appealing by the constant uniform changes and their sponsorship with Nike. It seems as though their brand became that change in uniform and to this day&#44; they continue to stay constant in those changes. We learn about the importance of a brand in chapter 4 of Graphic Design Solutions. It reads&#44; &quot;Each brand or group should have a well-defined essence&#44; a core brand personality. This allows for positioning which will help define the entity against the competition in the minds of the target audience&quot; (Landa&#44; p.80). It lists off a few examples of well-known brands and what they are usually related to. In this case&#44; when you think of Alabama you think of Crimson red and white. When you when of Minnesota Gophers&#44; you think of Maroon and gold. And finally&#44; when you think of the Oregon ducks&#44; you think&#44; well&#44; many variations of green and yellow</p>

<p>Aside from Oregon&#44; many other college football teams have set themselves up with sponsorships from companies like Nike and Under Armor. The reason people like to team up with these big named brands is because it draws positive attention to their team. Companies like Nike and Under Armor are well-known and are trusted by the public. They are highly fashionable athleisure in the generation which could indirectly play a role in the reason one would choose to play of a team where they would receive Nike clothes over some other smaller named brand. Marketing experts in Australia wrote a piece on celebrity endorsements and the effectiveness of big names collaborating/endorsing smaller companies. Their results showed that &#34;Endorser credibility has an indirect impact on brand equity when this relationship is mediated by brand credibility&#34; (Spry&#44; 882). Therefore&#44; when companies like Nike&#44;who are well-known for their sportswear success&#44; sponsor a certain team&#44; one might believe that the team is credible and working hard to become the next best thing. Landa&#44; in Graphic Design Principals says&#44; &#34;the Nike spirit certainly starts with the &#34;Just Do It&#34; tag line and becomes a point of view&#44; a motivational call to action&#44; with all the advertising across media contributing to that broader story&#34; (Landa&#44; 292). Simply put&#44; by Nike having this well-known persona&#44; people trust it and are called to it. Now&#44; that not to say that this is always the case. For example&#44; when Kendall Jenner did a peacemaker advisement for Pepsi&#44; critics were quick to discredit the reality star for her sad attempt to &#34;make a change&#34;. Clearly&#44; you can see that its important to pick the right person/company to sponsor your products/teams. It makes sense that Nike would sponsor college football teams as it makes those teams credible and hardworking.</p>

<p>Then there are teams that don&#39;t need a sponsorship at all. Teams like The University of Alabama who haven&#39;t changed their uniforms in decades. Alabama&#39;s recruiting approach is vastly different than teams like the Oregon Ducks. For example&#44; they win. That might sound like a joke but seriously&#44; within the last decade&#44; Alabama has become one of the highest ranked teams in college football. People want to go to school and play football for Alabama because of their history and their legacy. The coaches take a different approach when recruiting. They are all about tradition. The conversation is less about the flashy jerseys and more about the person who wore that jersey before them. It&#39;s more of an honor to wear that jersey with their number because of the people who have worn it before them and have gone on to do much bigger things. As of right now&#44; Alabama has 28 offensive players and 39 defensive players who are on NFL rosters (Inabinett&#44; 2019). Aside from their many wins&#44; Alabama also highly values the traditions that have been set in their team. From the time that the team was initially started to now&#44; if you look at their uniforms&#44; they haven&#39;t really changed at all. Despite being simply crimson red and white&#44; when they walk on the field&#44; you know exactly who they are. </p>

<p>Chapter 12 of Graphic Design Solutions discusses this idea of tradition and the reason it works. They explain it through a storytelling lens. Landa says&#44; &#34;Memorable advertising and branding involve good brand storytelling- the skill an act of presenting a brand or group as part of a greater narrative&#34; (Landa&#44;292). This is relevant in the Alabama case as the coaches use the uniforms as a tool for their recruiting by making the public aware of their successes. They go on to say&#44; &#34;Storytelling must be part of the strategy-formulating the brand or group with a point of view&#44; attributing a personality to it&#44; and imbuing it with an inner life&#34; (Landa&#44;292). Alabama does this by giving themselves that well-known winning legacy along with them never-changing jersey. They are able to pull off not changing their jerseys because of how good they are and because of how well-known their team is for the traditions and their narrative of being one of the greatest of all time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to switch gears and focus a little bit about how these ideas can relate to Aristotle&#39;s three appeals since we spent a good amount of time covering them in class over this semester. As we know&#44; Aristotle&#39;s three appeals are ethos&#44; pathos&#44; and logos. Ethos appeals to the credibility of content or an author. Pathos appeals to the emotions that the audience feels while seeing or read a piece. Finally&#44; logos appeals to the logic that an author or creator implements into their work. This can be represented by statistics, graphs, etc. You can find very little pathos and ethos in the University of Alabama&#39;s strategy. The pathos one might find could revolve around how they feel about the team. For example, someone who is a die-hard Auburn fan probably isn&#39;t too found of them. While a student at the University of Alabama on the other hand, might be ecstatic when they win or sad when they lose. As hard as I&#39;ve tried, I have failed to find any ethos appeals in the Tide&#39;s recruiting approach. You can find a lot of logos in the team as they are constantly winning. In fact, this is the first season in almost a decade that they are ranked less than the top 10. When you take a look at how to appeals can be implemented into the Oregon Duck&#39;s recruiting approach, each appeal is a little more prevalent. While the team is nowhere near as talented as The University of Alabama (in my opinion), it&#39;s almost as though that by displaying their Nike sponsorship, people want to try out for the team solely to have that brand deal in the future if they go pro. It&#39;s important to point out however, that Alabama actually has this same sponsorship. The team just doesn&#39;t choose to place such a high emphasis on their deal. By the ducks relying so heavily on their Nike sponsorship, this boosts their ethos appeal greatly. As I&#39;ve previously stated, people know who Nike is. They respect they and they trust the company. Unfortunately for the ducks, their logos isn&#39;t strong because up until this year, they&#39;ve barely been ranked. The emotions one would feel toward the ducks aligns with the how it does with Alabama&#39;s approach. Ones opinion on the team depends considerably on where they&#39;re from and what team they root for. Overall, as the teams differ in almost every way, it&#39;s interesting to see how closely they&#39;ve been ranked this year.</p>

<p>As you can see, both the Oregon ducks and the University of Alabama have recruiting strategies that vastly differ. While Alabama focuses tremendously on their winning to gain potential recruitees. This seems to be working for Alabama as the continue for almost a decade now to have the highest ranked players and sending a good amount of their players to the NFL every year. While the Oregon ducks on the other hand use a completely different strategy. The ducks rely heavily on their Nike sponsorship to get them the best players. That being said, it is important to note that while Alabama also has the same sponsorship, they just don&#39;t rely as heavily on it as the Oregon ducks do. The ducks switch their uniforms weekly while Alabama hasn&#39;t switched their uniforms in years. It&#39;s hard to say which approach is the absolute best but the tradition approach has been working well in Alabama&#39;s favor up until this year.</p>
